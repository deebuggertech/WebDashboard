This repo contains a modular and responsive web dashboard. I wrote it some time ago as I needed a UI for my smart home / IOT projects but couldn't find a suitable free pre-built solution.  I'm not really into web development so the whole thing could be a bit messy, but it works (at least for me). <br><br>
The user interface is very lightweight, so it can easily be deployed from a server running on an ESP8266 / ESP32, for example (with optimized caching and fetching of the chart library from a CND, of course). <br><br>
The colors of the two themes can be easily changed as they are all stored in CSS variables. The initial theme can be defined as static or based on the OS standard. <br>
